### Description
> proposed aim<br>

We aim to build a free Opensource API that will serve as an alternative to paid API's. Our API will help developers make efficient products that caters to needs of organisations that use WhatsApp as a mode of communication.

### Use case
Chintu was an organiser of an event and wanted to broadcast a message to the registrerd participants. But to broadcast teh message , he had to same all th emobile numbers and then boradcast the message. There were other options of using API's ( which cost hell high!). Chintu felt need of a free API/ website that can help him out. He just simply send tha message and all phone numbers ( in Comma separated format ) and rest job was done by the solution,
